## THE PROBLEM
More peoble, higher buildings, and all of the want to go from the 124 floor to the 24 floor at 12h for lunch.
The Elevators are the bottleneck.
With the ThyssenKrupp Multi Elevator which can travel horizontal too. So the goal is to design a simple elevator design in the building and to create a controlling system that predict the traffic situation in the elevator system.



## OUR FANTASTIC SOLUTION
We have desgned a small tool, to build and simulate a elevator system in a building.

## FEATURES

* Easy to use building editor, to plan a elevator layout.
* Simulation mode with several test scenarios (FullWorkDay, RushHour)
* Visual Simulation of cabin movement
* Elevator Call System with your Phone and get notified if you cabin is ready to enter.
